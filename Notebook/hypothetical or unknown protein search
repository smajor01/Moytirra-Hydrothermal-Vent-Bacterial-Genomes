# This file is meant to describe how I explore the identification of hypothetical proteins from the prokka .faa file.

# OXR-9

# make a list of all the AA sequences that identified as being hypothetical | remove the ">" character and write it to a new file
$ grep "hypothetical" OXR-9.faa | cut -c 2- > hypothetical_protein_list.txt

# use seqtk to subset the named sequences from the 
$ seqtk subseq OXR-9.faa hypothetical_protein_list.txt > hypothetical_proteins.faa

# blast the proteins
$ blastp -db refseq_protein -query hypothetical_proteins.faa -outfmt 6 -max_target_seqs 5 -out OXR-9_hypoProts_blast.txt

# this took over the weekend and did not complete. Trying and increasing the number of threads
$ blastp -db refseq_protein -query hypothetical_proteins.faa -outfmt 6 -max_target_seqs 5 -out OXR-9_hypoProts_blast.txt -num_threads 16

# take the sequence IDs from the blast search
