# Execute the genome through deepBGC on the server. This generates an ....antismash.json file (with other stuff).
# re-do the antismash and include the deepBGC json file with the "Upload exta annotations" option.

# run the antismash_converter.py script to make a table with the new antismash data.

# combine all the data and plot it with the R script "AntiSMASH deepBGC merging.Rmd"
