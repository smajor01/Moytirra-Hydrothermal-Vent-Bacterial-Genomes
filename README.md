## Sample collection
Sample collection is described in Polinski et al. 2023 (DOI 10.3389/fmars.2023.1219784)

## Microbe Culturing
Filters were submerged in 25% glycerol in sterile filtered seawater for cryopreservation. The filters  were thawed on ice and vortexed 
Bacteria were cultured on a variety of media composed of either 2% NaCl or artifical seawater (ASW).
Water was supplemented with 50% or 10% of yeast extract and peptone in DIFCO Marine Broth
The media was solidified with either gellan gum (Phytagel) or agar.
All media contained 200 µg/mL of Cycloheximide.

## DNA Extraction
Frozen 20 µL aliquots of each of the 12 isolates was thawed at room temperature and 600 µL of CTAB solution (100 mM Tris, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% CTAB) (160) was added to each aliquot with 0.6 µL β-mercaptoethanol and vortexed to resuspend the pellet. 15 µL of 20 mg/mL of proteinase K was then added and incubated at 65°C for 2.5 hours, followed by an addition of 1.2 µL of 10 mg/mL of RNase and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. 600 µL chloroform was added and mixed by inversion for 15 minutes. Tubes were spun for 10 minutes at 16,627 x g to separate the aqueous and organic layers. Approximately 0.5 mL of the aqueous layer was then transferred to a new tube where 1 mL of ice cold 95% ethanol was added and mixed by inversion. Isolated DNA was precipitated by storing at -20°C for 72 hours then centrifuged at 4°C, 16,627 x g, for 20 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and washed with fresh 70% ethanol and spun again for 5 minutes. The supernatant was decanted again, allowed to dry, and resuspended in 50 µL of MilliQ water.
